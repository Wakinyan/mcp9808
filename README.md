# mcp9808
Commandline tool to get the temperature for the mcp9808 via the ic2 Bus system on Linux systems.
I used the tool to get a temperature from the sensor connected to the rapsberry2 with raspbian (linux) ic2 Bus. I used OpenHab with the Exec tool to include this temperature into my home automation system.
